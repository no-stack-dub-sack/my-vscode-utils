# TODO / Wishlist

- [ ] Convert `//` into `/* */` comment.
- [ ] Move personal snippets that are useful into extension so I won't forget what snippets I've created (by using the list snippets command).
- [ ] Add support for different languages / single-line comment styles. E.g. change config from array to object: { '.js*,.ts*: "//", ".yml": "#" }
- [ ] Add snippets for "@ts" comments
- [ ] Fix auto-comment when comment starts mid-line with code on it
